# Gemini CLI Workstation - Polish and Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. FileUploadComponent.jsx Cleanup
- **Issue**: Unprofessional comments like "In a real implementation" and "I don't know why it says this"
- **Fix**: Removed all placeholder comments and made the code production-ready
- **Files**: `src/FileUploadComponent.jsx`

### 2. Shell Command Implementation
- **Issue**: Shell commands were referenced but UI showed inconsistent information
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated command indicators to properly show:
    - `/ commands` (instead of `# commands`)
    - `@ files` 
    - `! shell` (consistent with official Gemini CLI)
  - Added proper shell command support information
  - Updated placeholders and help text
- **Files**: `src/ModernChatInterface.jsx`

### 3. Command List Completeness
- **Issue**: Missing `/bug` command from official Gemini CLI
- **Fix**: Added `/bug` command to the autocomplete list
- **Files**: `src/ModernChatInterface.jsx`

### 4. File Organization
- **Issue**: Backup and broken files cluttering the source directory
- **Fix**: Moved all `.backup` and `.broken` files to `archive/` folder
- **Files**: Created `archive/` directory and moved:
  - `App.jsx.backup`
  - `EnhancedMcpManager.jsx.broken`
